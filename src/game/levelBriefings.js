    avoid: 'Oncoming taxis end the run. Dark patches are potholes — walking through them slows you, so jump over them.',

    title: 'City drive',
    setting: 'Industrial highway',
    goal: 'Drive to the end of the road. Survive the traffic and finish the route.',
    avoid: 'Do not crash into other cars or roadside obstacles. A crash costs 3 Coke bottles to continue.',
    collect: 'Collect Coke bottles on the road. You need a stash if you want a second chance after a crash.',

    goal: `Collect ${LEVEL3_BUS_FARE} rand coins for bus fare, then reach Park Station and catch the bus.`,
    avoid: 'Amaphara chase and punch you. Keep your health up — if HP hits zero, you are done. Do not walk into Park Station without enough fare.',
    collect: `Coins are scattered on sidewalks. You need ${LEVEL3_BUS_FARE} before the bus will take you.`,

    setting: 'Heatwave, water crisis',
    goal: 'Restore the water chain: fix De Waal Drive pipes, copy the Newlands valve lights, time Steenbras while the lamp is green, then reach the Vodacom Building.',
    avoid: 'Thirst drains in the heat and on failed puzzles. If thirst hits zero, you collapse. Walk away from a puzzle with Q if you need a moment.',
    collect: 'Pick up water bottles to refill thirst. Optional rand coins go to your store wallet.',

    setting: 'Stage 6 loadshedding',
    goal: 'Restore three substations (De Waal, Newlands, Steenbras), then reach Cape Town Stadium.',
    avoid: 'Looters chase you when the torch is on. The torch also drains battery — if battery dies you are stuck in the dark. Do not let HP hit zero.',

    setting: 'Cape Flats, late at night',
    goal: 'You cannot fight here. Navigate the Cape Flats without being spotted and reach safety at the Thuthuzela Care Centre.',
    avoid: 'Faceless patrollers walk the passages. Their red vision cones spot you, and sprinting near them is loud. Three sightings and it is over — each one sends you back to your last checkpoint.',
    collect: 'Read community notes (E) for facts about gender-based violence — find all 8 to cut your time. Rand coins go to your store wallet. Green porch lights mark the safe route.',

      'W A S D: move (camera follows behind you) · C: toggle crouch (or hold Ctrl) · Shift: sprint (makes noise) · E: read a note · P or Esc: pause',

    title: 'Soweto Homecoming',
    setting: 'Soweto, summer storm',
    goal: 'Check the clinic, school and spaza. Then race home and sandbag the stoep — three piles — before the canal surge hits.',
    avoid:
      'Deep water soaks you (three times and you fail). After the school, wind pushes you toward the taxis. After the spaza, a surge timer starts: if the sandbags are not down, the mission fails. Taxis hurt you, and they speed up in the storm. Heart tokens let you continue; when they run out you start from scratch.',
    collect:
      'Yellow street boards sit on the sidewalk and name the road for each stop. Follow Clinic Road east, School Road west, then Spaza Lane east. Pink heart tokens let you continue after a fail. Read flood-safety notes (E) — find all 8 to cut your time.',
